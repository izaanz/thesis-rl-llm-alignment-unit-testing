KodCode is the largest fully synthetic, open-source dataset providing verifiable coding tasks with paired solutions and test cases, making it ideal for training and evaluating AI models on code generation. It includes 12 distinct subsets that span a wide range of domains (from algorithmic problems to package-specific tasks) and a continuum of difficulty levels (from basic exercises to interview-style and competitive programming challenges). KodCode is designed to support both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for model training, and every example contains verifiable test cases to ensure solution correctness. 

A lightweight variant in this ecosystem is KodCode-Light-RL-10K, a smaller, RL-oriented subset of the full dataset. This version consists of 10,000 curated examples randomly sampled from a filtered version of the KodCode-V1-SFT-R1 dataset to focus on instructive, single-function coding problems suitable for reinforcement learning scenarios. The filtering ensures that tasks are of manageable difficulty (e.g., only one function definition per example, no classes or complex constructs), making it practical for training RL agents like PPO or GRPO on coding tasks with verifiable unit tests.
